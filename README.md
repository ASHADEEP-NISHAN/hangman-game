# hangman-game
Here's a summary of how the Hangman game works:

One player (the "word setter") selects a secret word.
The other player (the "guesser") starts by guessing a letter.
If the guessed letter is in the secret word, the corresponding dashes are replaced with the correct letter.
If the guessed letter is not in the secret word, the guesser's incorrect guess count increases, and a part of the "hangman" is drawn.
The guesser continues guessing letters until they either guess the entire word correctly or run out of incorrect guesses.
The game ends when the guesser either wins by guessing the word or loses by running out of incorrect guesses and the hangman is completely drawn.
